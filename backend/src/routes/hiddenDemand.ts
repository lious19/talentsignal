 * Scores (confidence + hard-to-fill) and upserts ONE CHUNK in ONE statement
 * via unnest(), not one `pool.query` per signal. That distinction is the
 * latency story here: Postgres also caps a query at 65535 bind parameters,
 * and a dynamically built multi-VALUES statement (11 columns * 10,000 rows =
 * 110,000 params) sits over that ceiling at the scale this story targets.
 * unnest() takes one array parameter per column -- 11 array params (plus one
 * scalar delimiter) total, regardless of chunk size -- and stays a single
 * atomic statement, so one chunk either fully upserts or fully fails, never
 * half-applies. `upsertBatch` below splits the full signal list into chunks
 * of UPSERT_CHUNK_SIZE so each individual statement stays well under the 5s
 * statement_timeout (06_decisions/042) -- the whole batch no longer commits
 * as one transaction, but that tradeoff is what makes 1,000+ real signals
 * ingestible at all.
 *
 * factor_breakdown needs no delimiter trick the way reasons does: each row's
 * breakdown is ONE jsonb value (an array of 4 factor objects), not several
 * sub-elements that unnest() would otherwise flatten across rows — so a
 * plain jsonb[] array, one parsed JSON document per row, is unambiguous.
